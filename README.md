# Employee-Salary-Predictor
It is a end-end Capstone-project that predicts the Salary of the employee based on the external factors

## Objective:
To Build a End-End Machine Learning Model that predicts the Salary of the Employees in the company based on the External factors like

1. Job Type ----- The Type of the Job that the Employee does
2. Degree ----- The Latest degree of the employee
3. Major ------ The Major subject in which the employee got his latest degree
